The core program logic is built around a central menu loop that directs users to various functionalities, including adding new students with input validation, viewing all enrolled students, inspecting detailed records, and deleting student files. The system emphasizes user experience through structured input validation, clear error messaging, and an intuitive workflow, ensuring data integrity and ease of use.

Designed as a command line application, this project demonstrates key programming concepts such as file I/O operations, data validation, and modular code structure, making it a practical tool for simple student record management without the need for a complex database system.
